Docs are great, but sometimes you can't beat a hands-on demo. They're perfect for sharing knowledge widely and getting feedback quickly. They're also a great chance to come together as a group and celebrate something we've been working on.

Leaning on my experience running remote training sessions and webinars, I ran internal workshops to showcase new tech. I chatted with internal teams who use our tools to build a schedule of workshops. I ran each workshop over Zoom.

The delivery would vary depending on the tech we were showcasing. Sometimes I'd hop into an IDE and write a script or run a live demo, other times I'd put together a PowerPoint and walk through they points.

As a distributed remote team, I recorded workshops and edited them. I made all recordings available online, with links to extra resources and a space to ask questions or leave comments.

We got great feedback on our tools out of workshops, which I slotted into dev backlogs in Jira.
