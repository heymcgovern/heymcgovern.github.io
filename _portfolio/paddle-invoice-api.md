Paddle has an invoicing solution, letting enterprise SaaS companies create and issue invoices for subscriptions. As a relatively recent addition to the platform, it didn't launch with an API. It's a key requirement for enterprise customers who typically hook their invoicing platform up to a CRM or ERP solution.

I worked with the engineering team who developed our Invoicing tool to create comprehensive documentation for a new set of APIs. I bedded into the team, joining stand-ups, backlog refinement meetings, and other scrum ceremonies to get a good idea of the context. I created a content plan for supporting resources, such as guides on authentication and versioning, and reviewed the draft API specs the team were using.

To write content, I created a Stoplight project and backed it to GitHub. I used Stoplight to create the OpenAPI specs initially, using an IDE to refine the raw OAS and abstract parameters and properties in a way that made sense for us. For written content, I used an IDE and linted prose using Vale.

I met with the product manager and engineering manager to review content regularly. I shared my progress using pull requests in GitHub and used Stoplight's versioning feature to let non-technical folks preview content.
