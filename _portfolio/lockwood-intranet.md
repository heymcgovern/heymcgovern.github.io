I joined Lockwood during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company had gone fully remote and was in the midst of a huge hiring surge as the game soared in popularity.

HR, IT, and other team leads were finding it difficult to onboard folks and deal with the volume of questions.

Leadership tasked me with creating an intranet, a single source for everything Lockwood.

To create a content plan and structure, I made notes on everything during my onboarding. I followed up with interviews with leads and reviewing existing docs.

To avoid creating a separate silo of content, I built the intranet on Confluence. I created spaces for each area, then used Refined to pull them all together into one website. The end result looks nothing like Confluence (thankfully!)

Our intranet is more than company documentation, it's become a hub for our culture. While some sections are locked down, we encourage folks to contribute to others. For example, we have crowdsourced guides on the best eats and drinks near each of our studios 😋

What's more, anyone at any level can create news posts that show front and center on the homepage. Folks regularly share team achievements, new feature releases, and pictures from socials.

Video is a first-class citizen, with an integration with Microsoft Stream. This means it's super simple for folks to share meeting recordings or demo new prototypes.
