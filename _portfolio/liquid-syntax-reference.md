Our platform let customers build documents and emails using HTML, CSS, and Liquid Syntax. Liquid is a template language that lets people place dynamic content and perform logic operations.

I worked with devs to build a complete learning and reference hub for Liquid. Info about the objects lived in `.rb` files in the codebase, and I used those as a basis for the docs.

I wrote in Markdown in Gitbook, checking in with the team using Slack and change requests. We tracked our progress in Asana.

Initially shared only with our more technical customers, I added  introductory content and made the site public. As a result, Current RMS has a flourishing community of people who share templates and tips!

These docs were a key part of our monetization strategy for COVID-19  recovery. With full docs, customers could now self-serve or work with a third-party dev. This meant we could offer a paid template customization service.

Lots of popular platforms use Liquid for templating, like Shopify and Jekyll. Many of the guides are [top results for Google searches]({{ "assets/img/liquid-google-search.png" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} for general "liquid syntax" queries.
