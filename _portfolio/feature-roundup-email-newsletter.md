Every month, I emailed customers to let them know what‚Äôs new and what‚Äôs next. It had great engagement, with emails regularly getting a 70%+ open rate and a good number of replies.

It started life as a kind of changelog by email, but became a newsletter in its own right. As well as showcasing new features, it became a key part of how we cultivated a sense of community among our customers.

* We gave folks a "peek behind the curtain," with a look at office life and teasers of new features.
* We highlighted the story behind the change, showing that we were responding to feedback.
* We included pictures from trade shows and highlights from our customer community.

I drafted content in Google Docs, getting feedback from teams across the company. I sent emails using Intercom, our marketing automation platform.
