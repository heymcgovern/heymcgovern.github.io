I joined Current RMS at launch, where we had a few guides written by our devs. They were long and written like a traditional user manual.

As we scaled, we shipped new features fast and our guides fell out of sync with our product. Where things were in our guides, we were still getting tickets about them. Customers couldn't find what they were looking for.

I created a new help center, full of short, task-based guides. Based on my time in sales and support, I organized guides around the way customers did things rather than our system. Our new guides explained, rather than described. They were full of screenshots and easy-to-scan headings.

I wrote in Intercom Articles, planning using Asana. For more technical articles, like reference data, I wrote in HTML & CSS and hosted them on our platform.

After the launch of our new guides, I created processes to make sure our guides stayed current. We deployed often, so I bedded into our dev team. I'd get technical specs and turn them into friendly support content.

I regularly reviewed support tickets, analytics, and feature engagement and tweak our help content to make
