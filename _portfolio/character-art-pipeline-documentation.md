Character artists create assets like clothes, accessories, make-up, and anything else that goes on a player's avatar. Selling character art assets is a key way that the game makes money.

Our game took off, so our team built a pipeline to get content out as fast as possible. As a result, we had close to no docs 😱

Leadership asked me to document the pipeline to make sure we had coverage of a key source of revenue.

I gathered resources from different sources, then worked with artists to figure out any gaps. I interviewed folks, sat in on workshops, and even created (poor quality!) assets to create docs for the entire pipeline.

I worked with a project manager and tracked project progress using Jira. I wrote in Confluence, using Snagit for screenshots and Screenflow for short videos. I mapped processes using Miro.
