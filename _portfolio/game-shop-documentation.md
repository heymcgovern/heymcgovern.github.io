As a free-to-play mobile game, the in-game Shop is the most important source of revenue. We scaled quickly, so had very little documentation about it. All the information lived in our lovely Retail Manager's head!

I worked with our Retail Manager and client developers to document how our shop works and the ways we can customize it. I interviewed folks about what they'd like to do with the Shop, then created a content plan of task based guides. As well as describing  how the Shop is built, the guides explain how to do common tasks.

Like most modern systems, the Shop is driven by JSON. This can be cumbersome to write, so I included tons of examples. Folks can easily copy-paste common configs to set up sales, edit categories, or change filtering options.

As well as guides, I sat in workshops with our Retail Manager about the science of selling. I created a set of best practices guides for pricing, sales, and how to retail items effectively. I included case studies and examples of previous sales, showing how we can change shopper behavior to drive sales.

I created content in Confluence, using Snagit for screenshots and Screenflow for videos. I tracked progress using Jira.
