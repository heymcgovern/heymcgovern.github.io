Leadership launched a company-wide Agile transformation project to help us keep scaling up. They were keen to cultivate a culture where folks understood the "why" as well as the "what" of Agile.

I worked with Agile coaches to create PowerPoints, videos, and best practice guides about Agile. Later, I published blog posts and case studies to celebrate our progress and show how Agile was working for us.

We planned and tracked using Jira.

As part of this project, I completed a [PowerPoint course](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-f9f43e2d-2bf2-4c54-b01d-5cdd5533762e/){:target="_blank"} to take my presentation skills to the next level 🚀
