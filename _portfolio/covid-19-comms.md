  - 1Ô∏è‚É£ We had one coherent message across all channels during an extremely difficult time for our customers.
  - ü§ù Our tone was sincere and people felt we were in it with them.
  - üèÅ Seen to be quick off the mark as one of the first in our industry to respond.
  - ‚úâÔ∏è Support reps were able to create replies to customers quickly at a time when we saw a huge spike in tickets.
  - üÜï Onboarded new folks to our accounts system easily using our newly documented processes.
  - ‚ú® Fed into a series of blog posts about "the new normal," where we showcased sales and admin features.

Current RMS only serves events, AV, and production companies. COVID-19 hit our customer base hard, wiping months's worth of orders almost overnight.

I worked with marketing and leadership to create content for our COVID-19 response, including:

1. Messaging for our customer community to explain what we were doing to help.
1. Resources to help support feel confident replying to customers.
1. Docs for internal processes so we could transition to full remote working.

Where our competition was quiet or sent the same emails as everyone else, our response was open and honest. Customers appreciated our candor.

I especially enjoyed creating microcopy for our in-app messenger. Only business owners got our emails, so I distilled our response for all users of our app with links to learn more.

Internally, I documented processes so we could give everyone in the team access to our billing system. To go with this, I worked with leadership on a playbook to help everyone respond to tickets about billing.

We worked quickly, using Asana to plan and track. I drafted content in Google Docs, which we then published on our website using Markdown and Jekyll.
