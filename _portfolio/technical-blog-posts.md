Where our teams needed technical content, I was their first port of call. I wrote and edited blog posts and worked on more technical marketing collateral.

I worked with teams across the company on posts, but primarily marketing. We planned in Asana, using Google Docs to collaborate on drafts. We published these to the commercial website using Markdown and Jekyll.

I usually worked on blog posts about features, our development processes, or more technical topics like the API. We were one of the few platforms at the time to have an API and integrations, so publishing blog posts brought more technical prospects.

I linked to [our guides]({{ "portfolio/current-rms-knowledge-base" | relative_url }}) and [embedded videos]({{ "portfolio/current-rms-support-videos" | relative_url }}) throughout, getting value out of content we'd already made and strengthening our SEO.
