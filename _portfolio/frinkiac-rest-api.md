I always teach new folks about REST APIs and JSON using [Frinkiac](https://frinkiac.com/){:target="_blank"}. `frinkiac.com/api/random` returns a random screencap from The Simpsons, along with a bunch of metadata. It's a great entry to the world of APIs and JSON data.

Turns out, though there are lots of integrations, there are no API docs out there for Frinkiac!

I figured this would be a good chance to use the Open API spec and Readme.io for a personal project.

I used the inspector in Chrome on Frinkiac.com, along with the source for other integrations to make a list of endpoints. I wrote docs using the Open API spec and hosted on Readme.io.

I love Frinkiac and use it daily. Huge thanks to [the creators](https://frinkiac.com/faq){:target="_blank"} and everyone in the community who's made integrations ❤️
