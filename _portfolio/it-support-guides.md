Our IT team were swamped. They'd helped everyone move to remote working, setting up too many laptops to count. They'd also onboarded a record amount of new folks to the company, all while in the middle of a move to a bigger studio. Tickets were coming thick and fast!

The team asked me to create guides to ease the rate of support tickets and improve IT onboarding.

I worked with the team to create a content plan that included the most popular systems. Each guide covered a solution that we used and was broken up into task-based sections. For example, the Zoom guide sections for setting a background, adding Zoom links to meetings, and recording calls. I added a bunch of screenshots and (very) short looping videos so people could skim guides.

All our suppliers had good knowledge bases, so I kept the guides high-level and linked out to articles. Our guides instead covered best practices and company-specific ways of working. For example, that Zoom guide included links to our fun branded backgrounds.

The onboarding process went from a long email with lots of step-by-step instructions to a short doc with links to our IT guides. As a result, the team were able to get folks onboarded much faster and with fewer follow up calls and tickets.

The IT guides are living documents. The structure and templates that I created mean the team can hop in and create or edit guides easily
