When I started, I got a 60+ page Word document: OUR COMPANY HANDBOOK.

It was stuffy and full of legalese. It wasn't especially easy to navigate, with a super long table of contents at the start. People across the company had different versions the handbook floating around.

I worked with HR and other teams to liberate policies from the Word document and centralize them on [our intranet]({{ "portfolio/lockwood-intranet" | relative_url }}).

I helped teams create a content plan, then reviewed written policies to make sure the language was clear and concise. Plain English is important because it makes policies accessible for everyone.

Inclusive language is important to me. I worked to make sure that we used language and terms that include everyone throughout.

After we publicized the new policies, our HR Slack channel for queries got a lot quieter! I created templates and best practices on the way we write, so the team can keep creating policies that are consistent and clear.
