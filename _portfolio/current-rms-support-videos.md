To complement [our new guides]({{ "portfolio/current-rms-knowledge-base" | relative_url }}), I partnered with marketing to create a collection of videos.

I analyzed tickets and worked with product and support to build a backlog of videos in Asana. I scripted them in Google Docs, then recorded and edited using Screenflow. We looped in folks across the company for voiceover, making sure the videos reflected the diversity of our team.

Before starting, I researched video content to see what works. People's attention tends to drop after a couple of minutes, so I kept our videos short and pithy.

Rather than dull explainers, I focused on examples and talked about the value of features. This meant we could share our videos on social media and in emails with prospects, as well as in our support guides.
