Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my tech writing portfolio. It's a Jekyll site that creates a page for everything in the `portfolio` collection. The homepage prints all items in this collection, using [Masonry](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/masonry/) to lay things out like magic âœ¨.

In the future, I may add an about page and blog. In this case, I'll probably add a homepage and move portfolio items to their own section too. I wanted to get something out as soon as possible.

I used [jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme) as a basis for my theme.

There's a few things that I'd like to look at in the future:

* Move `stakeholders` and `tools` for portfolio items to data files.
* Add categories to the homepage so folks can filter by category.
* Set up the nav so it's a Liquid object, rather than hard-coded into the header include file.
* Add dark mode support.
