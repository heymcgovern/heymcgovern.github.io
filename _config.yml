  Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I create guides, images, videos, and other technical content that's
  engaging and exciting. I love docs-as-code and creating processes that help
  everyone work better together. You can trust me to take on new product or
  feature docs, as well as reviews and revamps.

  # Manually ordered this collection so I can push up stuff that's more

  # UPDATE: Manual ordering only supported by Jekyll 4; GitHub Pages uses 3.9.x.
  # Added a `order` to front matter, then sorted the loop in the template.
